# 1. Introduction

The Data Model Mapper tool enables to convert several file types (e.g. CSV, Json, GeoJson) to the different [Data Models](https://gitlab.com/synchronicity-iot/synchronicity-data-models) defined in the [SynchroniCity Project](https://synchronicity-iot.eu/). 
The files in input can contain either rows, JSON objects or GeoJson Features, each of them representing an object to be mapped to an NGSI entity, according to the selected Data Model.

In particular, it performs following steps:

1) **Parsing:**
    - Parse input file, by converting it into a row/object stream.
2) **Streaming:**
    - Each row/object coming from the stream is converted to an intermediate object.
3) **Mapping:** 
    - By using the input JSON Map, convert the intermediate object to an NGSI entity, according to a specific target Data Model.
4) **Validation and report:**
    - Validate resulting object against the JSON schema corresponding to a target Data Model. It leverages [AJV JSON Schema Validator](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv).
    - Produce a report file with validated and unvalidated objects.
- **Writing: Orion CB or File**
    - Validated objects are sent to the configured [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/) and/or to a local file.

The tool is developed in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and can be started as a command line tool. Soon it will be possible to start it as a REST server

## 3. Configuration

The configuration of the Data Model Mapper consists of the following steps:
- [**Application**](#conf-application) (optional, left intact to use defaults)
- [**Input**](#conf-input) (mandatory)
- [**ID Pattern**](#conf-id) (mandatory)
- [**Rows Range**](#conf-rows) (optional)
- [**Writers**](#conf-writers) (mandatory)
 
> **`IMPORTANT`** The tool takes its default configuration from the `config.js` file, but following configurations will be overriden if the corresponding parameters are provided as Command Line arguments or in the HTTP request, depending on which running mode was selected for the tool:
- **Input**
- **ID Pattern**
- **Rows Range** 
- **Writers** 

--------------------

<a name="conf-application" />

### 3.1 Configuration - Application 

The global setup is defined in the `config.js` file
- Rename the `config.template.js` file to `config.js` and modify accordingly to the following options:

  - **``env``**: the execution environment. Accepted values are:
    - **`debug`**: the logs are written in the **``/logs``** folder. 
    - **`production`**: the logs are displayed in the console output.

  - **``logLevel``**: logging level for [WINSTON](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston). Valid values are the followings:
    - **``error, warn, info, verbose, debug, silly``**

  - **``writers``**: The names of Writers, the handlers for writing the resulting mapped NGSI entities to different outputs. Accepted values (one or more) are:
    - **`orionWriter`**: To write NGSI entities **directly** to a specified **Orion Context Broker**.
    - **`fileWriter`**: To write NGSI entities **locally** to a specified file.

--------------------

<a name="conf-input" />

### 3.2 Configuration - Input

- In order to perform the mapping process, the tool takes **three** inputs:
  1) **`Source`**: The path of the **source file** containing data to be mapped (CSV, JSON or GeoJson).
  2) **`Map`**, specifying the mapping between source fields and destrination fields. It is a **JSON** , where the key-value pairs represent the mapping for each row contained in the source file.
  3) **`Target Data Model`**: the name of the **target SynchroniCity Data Model**.

These three inputs, can be specified either in the **`config.js`** file, as CLI arguments or in the HTTP request (depending on running mode). Following sections describe each option.

#### 3.2.1 Inputs configuration in config file

In order to set Input configuration as config file parameters, modify the following fields of the `config.js` file:

- **``sourceDataPath``** : The path of the source file. If it is a Windows path, it **MUST** be with double backslashes (e.g. **C:\\\Users\\\\....**).
- **``mapPath``**: The path of JSON Map, **MUST** be with `.json` extension. (See following [Mapping Guide](#mapping) section)
- **``targetDataModel``**: The name of target **Data Model** (must match with those contained in the **/dataModels** folder).

**Example:**
```
sourceDataPath: "path/to/sourcefile.csv"
```

#### 3.2.2 Inputs configuration as CLI arguments

In order to use inputs configuration as CLI arguments, append following arguments to the `node mapper` command:

- ``-s, --sourceDataPath``
- ``-m, --mapPath``
- ``-d, --targetDataModel``

**Example:**
```
node mapper -s "path/to/sourcefile.csv" -m "path/to/mapFile.json -d "WeatherObserved"
```

> **`Note`** Previous CLI arguments, if provided, will **override** the default ones specified in `config.js` file.

#### 3.2.3 Inputs configuration in the HTTP request

Soon available

--------------------

<a name="conf-id"/>

### 3.3 Configuration - Id Pattern

Following configurations are relative to fields that will compose the generated IDs of mapped entities, according to the SynchroniCity’s Entity ID Recommendation.

> **`Note`** Id Pattern fields can be specified either in the **`config.js`** file, as CLI arguments or in the HTTP request (depending on running mode).

#### 3.3.1 Id Pattern  configuration in config file

In order to set Id Pattern configuration as config file parameters, modify the following fields of the `config.js` file:

- **``site``**: can represent a RZ, City or area that includes several different IoT deployments, services or apps (e.g., Porto, Milano, Santander, Aarhus, Andorra …).
- **``service``**: represents a smart city service/application domain for example parking, garbage, environmental etc.
- **``group``**: This could be optional. The group part can be used for grouping assets under the same service and/or provider (so it can be used to identify different IoT providers). It is responsibility of OS sites to maintain proper group keys.

The Entity Name (last part of ID pattern), is generated either automatically or by specifying it in the dedicated field **`entitySourceId`** of the JSON Map, as described in the Mapping Guide section.

#### 3.3.2 Id pattern configuration as CLI arguments

In order to use inputs configuration as CLI arguments, append following arguments to the `node mapper` command:

- **``--si, --site``**
- **``--se, --service``**
- **``--gr, --group``**

>**`Note`** Previous CLI arguments, if provided, will **override** the default ones specified in `config.js` file.

#### 3.3.3 Id pattern configuration in the HTTP request

Soon available

To summarize, the ID of the mapped entity will be composed by:

- **`urn:ngsi-ld`**, statically added.
- **`entity-type`**, the Target Data Model name, as specified in [**Input**](#conf-input) Configuration step .
- **`site`**, **`service`**, **`group`**, whose values defined as described previously.
- **`entityName`**: as specified either in the **`entitySourceId`** field of JSON Map or automatically generated.


<a name="conf-rows" />

### 3.4 Configuration - Rows Range

Following configuration are relative to the rows range (start, end) of the input file that will be mapped. It is useful when you want to map only a part of the input file; in case of huge files, it is **recommended** (in order to easily inspect mapping and writing reports), to use a **"paginated mapping"**, where consecutive and relatively small (2000/5000) rows ranges of the input file are used.
> **`Note`** Rows range can be specified either in the **`config.js`** file, as CLI arguments or in the HTTP request (depending on running mode).

#### 3.4.1 Rows Range configuration in config file

In order to set Rows Range configuration as config file parameters, modify the following fields of the `config.js` file:

- **``rowStart``**: Row of the input file from which the mapper will start to map objects (Allowed values are integers >= 0).
- **``rowEnd``** : Last Row of the input file that will be mapped (Allowed values are integers > 0 or `Infinity` value, indicating "until the end of file").

#### 3.4.2 Rows Range configuration as CLI arguments

In order to use Row Range configuration as CLI arguments, append following arguments to the `node mapper` command:

- **``--rs, --rowStart``**
- **``--re, --rowEnd``**


> **`Note`**. Previous Command Line arguments, if provided, will **override** the default ones specified in `config.js` file.

#### 3.4.3 Rows Range configuration in the HTTP request

Soon available

<a name="conf-writers" />

### 3.5 Configuration - Writers

The Writers handlers are responsible of writing the resulting mapped NGSI entities to different outputs.
The current available writers are:
  - **`orionWriter`**: To write NGSI entities **directly** to a specified **Orion Context Broker**.
  - **`fileWriter`**: To write NGSI entities **locally** to a specified file.

#### 3.5.1 Configuration - Orion Writer

The Orion Writer will try to create a new entity, by sending a **POST** to ``/v2/entities`` endpoint of the provided Context Broker URL. In case of already existing entity, unless the `skipExisting` parameter is set to `true`, it tries to update the entity, by sending a POST to ``/v2/entities/{existingId}/attrs`` endpoint.
It is able also to send requests **behind an HTTP proxy** (see below).

> **`Note`** Orion Writer **URL** can be specified either in the **`config.js`** file, as CLI arguments or in the HTTP request (depending on running mode).

##### Orion configuration in configuration file

Modify the following properties in ``config.orionWriter`` object contained in the ``config.js`` file:

- **`orionUrl`**: The Base URL (without /v2...), of the Orion Context Broker where to write.
- **`enableProxy`**: (`true|false`) Enables the write to send requests through a proxy.
- **`proxy`**: Proxy URL in the form `http://user:pwd@proxyHost:proxyPort` .
- **`skipExisting`**: (`true|false`) Skip mapped entities (same ID) already existing in the CB, otherwise try to update them

To send entities to a secured Context Broker, modify following properties:

- **`orionAuthHeaderName`** : The name of Authentication Header (e.g. **"Authorization"**).
- **`orionAuthToken`**: : The value of Authentication Header (e.g **Bearer XXXX** ).

##### Orion configuration as CLI arguments

In order to use Orion Writer configuration as CLI arguments, when launching the tool with ``node mapper`` command, append following argument:

- **`-u, --orionUrl`**: The Base Url (without /v2…), of Orion Context Broker.

> **`Note`** Previous Command Line arguments, if provided, will **override** the default ones specified in `config.js` file.

#### Orion configuration in the HTTP request

Soon available

#### 3.5.2 Configuration - File Writer

The File Writer will write each mapped NGSI Object inside a JSON Array, stored locally in a file. It is useful when the tool is used in Comman Line mode; in the Server Mode there will be a dedicated API to download the resulting file.

##### File Writer configuration in configuration file

Modify the following properties in ``config.fileWriter`` object contained in the ``config.js`` file:
- **`filePath`**: The full path, icnluding the extension of where to store locally the resulting file.
- **`addBlankLine`**: (`true|false`) Put a carriage return between resulting objects in the file.

##### File Writer configuration as CLI arguments

In order to use File Writer configuration as CLI arguments, when launching the tool with ``node mapper`` command, append following argument:

- **`-f, --outFilePath`**: The full path, icnluding the extension of where to store locally the resulting file.

> **`Note`** Previous Command Line arguments, if provided, will **override** the default ones specified in `config.js` file.

#### File Writer configuration in the HTTP request

Soon available

# 4. Mapping Guide

This section describes, with examples, how to compile the JSON Map file, whose path must be specified as input configuration, as described in [Inputs Configuration](#conf-input) section.

## 4.1 Source Input File

> **`IMPORTANT`** The source file must be **`CSV`**, **`Json`** or **`GeoJson`** and **MUST BE** in **`UTF8`** encoding. If the source file has another encoding (e.g. ANSI), please first convert it to UTF8 encoding (e.g. by using conversion with NotePad++).

Depending on input source type, the tool behaves accordingly:
- **CSV**
    The tool extracts the columns from the first row, and for each next row creates an intermediate data object (JSON), where each key-value field will have the CSV column as key and the specific CSV row value as value. In this way, every intermediate object coming from a CSV row will be mapped in a NGSI entity.

- **JSON**
        The input file must be already in the "intermediate" form, that is a **JSON Array**, where each object contains key-value fields to be mapped directly to a NGSI entity.

- **GeoJSON**
    The file must be a **Feature Collection**. So, the file must be in the form:
     ```
      {
       "type": "FeatureCollection",
       "features": [
          {
             "type": "Feature",
             "geometry": {...},
             "properties": {...}
          },
          ........
       ]}
    ```

## 4.2 Mapping

The tool needs the Mapping JSON, in order to know how to map each source field of the parsed row/object in the destination fields. The map **MUST** be a **well formed JSON** and have `.json` extension.

### What is the Map?

The Map consists of a JSON, that is a collection of **`KEY`-`VALUE` pairs**, where, for each pair:

- the **`KEY`** is the **DESTINATION** field, belonging to a target Data Model (e.g. *address* or *totalSlotNumber* for *BikeHireDockingStation*).

- the **`VALUE`** is the **selector** that represents the **SOURCE** field/column, belonging to the source object/row.

- If the **`KEY`** has the reserved name **`entitySourceId`**, its **`VALUE`** will represent the source field from which the **EntityName** part of ID will be taken, according to SynchroniCity Entity ID Recommendation (See [Id Pattern Configuration](##conf-id) section).
  


> **`EXAMPLE`** - **`KEY`-`VALUE` pair** 
  ```
  { ...
  
  "totalSlotNumber" : "sourceFieldName"
//   KEY            |    VALUE 
// DESTINATION      |    SOURCE          

  ... }
  ```

> **`NOTE`** the **SOURCE** value (whose field is represented in the example by the `VALUE` **"sourceFieldName"**) will be mapped to the **DESTINATION** field (represented by the `KEY` **"totalSlotNumber"**)

#### Which value types from the source fields are supported?

The **`VALUE`** of a mapping  **`KEY`-`VALUE` pair** is the **SOURCE** field name. The values, grabbed from these source fields/columns represented by the **`VALUE`** selectors, can have one of the following types:
- **Single value**: String, Number, Boolean (for **CSV files** is the unique option)
- **Multiple value**: A String, Number or Boolean array
- **Nested value**: A String, Number or Boolean in a field nested inside an object

Depending on the types of source and destination fields, the **`VALUE`** selector of the mapping pair can be one of the followings:

1) **String**:  
   - The **SOURCE** field has a simple (String, Number or Boolean) value, example:
     ```
     //NOTE. This is the SOURCE file, not the mapping pair.
     "sourceFieldName": "15"
     ```
     - The relative **KEY-VALUE PAIR**  will be:
         ```
         "totalSlotNumber" : "sourceFieldName"
         ```
      - The **result** of the mapping will be:
         ```
         "totalSlotNumber" : 15
         ```
     ----------------------
     
   - The **SOURCE** field is a "**nested field**", and MUST be specified in the **`VALUE`** selector with dot notation (specifically used in case of **JSON/GeoJson** inputs, as the following), example:
      ```
      //Note that this is the SOURCE file, not the mapping pair.
      "sourceAddress":{
               "sourceStreetName" : "Example Avenue"
      }
      ```
      - The relative **`KEY`-`VALUE` pair**  will be:
        ```
        "destinationStreetName" : "sourceAddress.sourceStreetName"
        ```
       
      - The **result** of the mapping will be:
        ```
        "destinationStreetName" : "Example Avenue"
        ```

     ----------------------
   - If you want as value of the **DESTINATION** field a specific **"static"** value instead of the one coming from a **SOURCE** field, the **`VALUE`** selector must be specified as **`static:`** (e.g. **`static: something`**), the following substring (**`something`**), will represent the **ACTUAL VALUE** of the resulting field. This is a way for specifying custom values that are not present as field values in the **SOURCE** object/row.

2) **String Array**: If the **`VALUE`** selector is a string array, each string represents a **SOURCE** field (or the actual value if in the **`static:`** form). Their values will be concatenated (with spaces as separator) and mapped to the corresponding **DESTINATION** field (represented  by the **`KEY`** in the mapping pair).
3) **Object**:  One or more source fields will be mapped to a structured/nested **DESTINATION** field. In this case, we have a **`KEY`-`OBJECT` pair**, where each **`SUBKEY`** has its own **`VALUE`**, example:
   ```
   "destinationAddress" : {
       "destinationStreetName" : "sourceStreetName"
    }
    ```
    or if also the **SOURCE** field is a "**nested field**" (as previous case, MUST use dot notation):
      ```
   "destinationAddress" : {
       "destinationStreetName" : "sourceAddress.sourceStreetName"
    }
    ```
    - The **result** of the mapping will be:
      ```
      "destinationAddress" : {
           "destinationStreetName" : "Example Avenue"
      }
      ```   
> **`Note`** Following examples omit mandatory fields for mapped NGSI entities, such as **"id"** and **"type"**. These are automatically included by the tool.

------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 Mapping Examples

#### CSV Example

We have as input a **CSV** file, representing Bike Sharing stations. We want to map each CSV row to an entity of the target Data Model **BikeHireDockingStation**.

The first row contains the columns definitions:

```
Location;Area;SubArea;Name;AvailableSlots;TotalSlots;
 ```

The second line, the first one representing a mappable source object is:

```
Alemagna Avenue;Museum;Triennale di Milano;10;40;
```

The resulting **Map**, according to the target Data Model, will be:

```
{
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Location"
   },
   "areaServed": "Area",
   "totalSlotNumber": "TotalSlots"
}
```

Note that the "address" destination field, is a structured object, containing the **DESTINATION** field *streetAddress*, which is mapped to the **SOURCE** field *Location*. So the corresponding value *"Alemagna Avenue"* will be mapped as the value of the *streetAddress*.
The resulting object will be:

```
{
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Alemagna Avenue"
   },
   "areaServed": "Museum",
   "totalSlotNumber": 40
}
```

**Alternatively**, we would instead concatenate both *Area* and *SubArea* **SOURCE** fields to the **DESTINATION** *areaServed* field. In that case the **Map** will be:

```
{
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Location"
   },
   "areaServed": [
      "Area",
      "SubArea"
   ],
   "totalSlotNumber": "TotalSlots"
}
 ```

The resulting object will be:

 ```
{
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Alemagna Avenue"
   },
   "areaServed": "Museum - Triennale di Milano",
   "totalSlotNumber": 40
}
 ```
 
Finally, if we want to specify DIRECTLY a **static** custom value for a resulting mapped field, the **`VALUE`** selector of the **`KEY`- `VALUE`** mapping pair will have the **`static:` prefix**.
The **Map** will be:

```
{
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Location"
   },
   "areaServed": [
      "Area",
      "SubArea"
   ],
   "totalSlotNumber": "TotalSlots",
   "name": [
      "static:Racks - ",
      "Location"
   ]
}
```

In this case we are concatenating, for target "**name**" field, two values:
1) **"Rastrelliere "** literally
2) The value contained in the source field **"Location"**

The resulting object will be:
 ```
{
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "Alemagna Avenue"
   },
   "areaServed": "Museum - Triennale di Milano",
   "totalSlotNumber": 40,
   "name": "Racks - Alemagna Avenue"
}
```
---------------------

#### GeoJson Example

We have as input a **GeoJson** file, containing a Feature Collection and representing Bike Sharing stations. We want to map each Feature as an entity of the target Data Model **BikeHireDockingStation**.

For instance, for the feature:

```
{
   "type": "Feature",
   "geometry": {
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [
         9.189043,
         45.464725
      ]
   },
   "properties": {
      "ID": 1,
      "BIKE_SH": "001 Duomo 1",
      "INDIRIZZO": "P.za Duomo",
      "ANNO": 2008,
      "STALLI": 24,
      "LOCALIZ": "Carreggiata"
   }
}
```

The resulting **JSON Map**, according to the Target Data Model, will be:

```
{
   "name": "properties.BIKE_SH",
   "location": "geometry",
   "totalSlotNumber": "properties.STALLI",
   "entitySourceId": "properties.BIKE_SH",
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "properties.INDIRIZZO"
   }
}
```

In this case, **nested source fields** can be accessed through the dot notation.
> **`NOTE`** the **DESTINATION** *`location`* field is treated in a special way: the whole **SOURCE** field value will be taken and put in the resulting *location* field.

The final resulting object will be:

```
{
   "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:BikeHireDockingStation:site:service:group:entityName",
   "name": "001 Duomo 1",
   "location": {
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [
         9.189043,
         45.464725
      ]
   },
   "address": {
      "streetAddress": "P.za Duomo"
   },
   "totalSlotNumber": 24
}
```

The ID is be composed by:

- **`urn:ngsi-ld`**, statically added.
- **`entity-type`**, target Data Model, as specified in [**Input**](#conf-input) Configuration step .
- **`site`**, **`service`**, **`group`**, whose values was defined in [**ID Pattern**](#conf-id) Configuration step.
- **`entityName`**: as specified either in the **`entitySourceId`** field of JSON Map or automatically generated.
